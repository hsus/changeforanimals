title: Championing Farm Animal Welfare
description: |
  In the United States, millions of breeding pigs and egg-laying hens are kept in metal cages where they are virtually immobilized for their entire lives. Demand for meat is rising internationally, and factory-farming practices are spreading to the developing world. In the U.S., we’ve worked with more than 100 major retailers and the biggest names in the food industry to remove extreme confinement practices from their supply chains, and helped more than 100 school systems nationwide go meatless on Mondays. It’s time to expand our reach abroad.

    quote: |
     The HSUS’s farm animal protection campaign epitomizes effectiveness. They’re combating factory farming, slashing demand for meat, and are building a better world for all of us, animals and people alike.

goals:
  - Pass <em>two major anti-confinement</em> initiatives and work with U.S. farmers and retailers to move a billion animals to higher welfare standards.

  - <em>Launch Meatless Monday in five Asian cities</em> and persuade five multinational corporations  to make Asian operations crate-free.

  - Work through the finance sector to <em>move 100 million animals out of extreme confinement</em> in  Central Asia and stem the introduction of such systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.

  - Implement <em>meat-reduction policies</em> at hundreds of institutions across the U.S., such as school  districts, hospital chains, corporate cafeterias and more.
