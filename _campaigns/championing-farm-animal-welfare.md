title: Championing Farm Animal Welfare
description: |
  In the United States, millions of breeding pigs and egg-laying hens are kept in metal cages where they are virtually immobilized for their entire lives. Demand for meat is rising internationally, and factory-farming practices are spreading to the developing world. In the U.S., we’ve worked with more than 100 major retailers and the biggest names in the food industry to remove extreme confinement practices from their supply chains, and helped more than 100 school systems nationwide go meatless on Mondays. It’s time to expand our reach abroad.

    title: <strong>Inspiring Others:</strong> Don Sinex’s Story
    body: |
     <strong>Don Sinex</strong>, a real estate developer in New York City and Vermont, inherited his compassion for all animals—and especially dogs—from his mother, and now he’s dedicated to eliminating animal cruelty. A longtime friend of The HSUS, Don has given generously to our programs to save animals from cruel situations such as puppy mills. In 2014, in partnership with Shoshi Fu and Devonwood Investors LLC, Don asked that his donation be used to customize a special vehicle for our Animal Rescue Team. In recognition of his gift, the customized truck and shelter trailer will be named Rescue Team Ranger and Rescue Team Chloe after his two beloved English springer spaniels. Don hopes that generous gifts like his will inspire others to support the lifesaving work of The HSUS.
