title: Resolving Wildlife Conflicts
description: |
  Wild animals have suffered too much, for too long, because of outdated, destructive and lethal “solutions” to managing wildlife. We need humane, science-based approaches to co-existing with our wild neighbors. We’re on the forefront of this research, carrying out innovative immunocontraception research projects in partnership with leading veterinary medicine schools. And we’re working internationally to end the cruel trade in wildlife parts and to end the trophy hunting of specific animals.

goals:
  - <em>Decrease the trade</em> in shark fins, ivory, rhino horns and pangolins.

  - Decrease trophy hunting of <em>large carnivores in the US</em> in five states and decrease the import of lion, leopard, elephant, hippo and giraffe trophies to the U.S.

  - Expand <em>wildlife fertility control</em> to manage 10% of the wild horse and burro population (5,000 horses and 1,000 burros would have received treatment) and to manage white-tailed deer in five urban communities.

  - Expand the <em>Wild Neighbors program</em>, in which 25 communities will adopt innovative, non-lethal methods to manage their urban wildlife conflicts.

    title: <strong>Inspiring Others:</strong> Don Sinex’s Story
    body: |
     <strong>Don Sinex</strong>, a real estate developer in New York City and Vermont, inherited his compassion for all animals—and especially dogs—from his mother, and now he’s dedicated to eliminating animal cruelty. A longtime friend of The HSUS, Don has given generously to our programs to save animals from cruel situations such as puppy mills. In 2014, in partnership with Shoshi Fu and Devonwood Investors LLC, Don asked that his donation be used to customize a special vehicle for our Animal Rescue Team. In recognition of his gift, the customized truck and shelter trailer will be named Rescue Team Ranger and Rescue Team Chloe after his two beloved English springer spaniels. Don hopes that generous gifts like his will inspire others to support the lifesaving work of The HSUS.
