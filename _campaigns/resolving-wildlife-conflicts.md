title: Resolving Wildlife Conflicts
description: |
  Wild animals have suffered too much, for too long, because of outdated, destructive andlethal “solutions” to human-wildlife conflicts. We need humane, science-based approaches to co-existing with our wild neighbors. We’re on the forefront of this research, carrying out innovative deer immunocontraception research projects in partnership with leading veterinary medicine schools.

      "<em>THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES IS LEADING THE CHARGE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE WILDLIFE</em> through innovative non-lethal techniques that are humane, effective and provide sustainable solutions for our communities nationwide.<br>— James Cromwell,<br>Actor, <em>Babe<em>"

goals:
  - Help four wildlife rehabilitation centers, animal control facilities or shelters reduce wild animal intake and train 300 local groups on urban wildlife conflicts annually.

  - Establish principles and training through the Humane Wildlife Control Association.

  - Register long-acting ZonaStat-H and PZP immunocontraception in 10 states.

  - Treat 5,000 wild mares with ZonaStat-H immunocontraceptive and reduce the number of government-held wild horses and burros by helping find them homes.

  - Pass four state laws requiring consideration of non-lethal methods, implement 10 humane management community plans and replace five lethal programs with fertility control.

  - Combat the use of abusive practices and lethal control of wildlife, such as steel-jawed leghold traps and toxic poisons.
