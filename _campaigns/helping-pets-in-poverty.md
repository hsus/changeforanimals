title: "Helping Pets in Poverty"
description: |
  We’ve made great strides in providing services to underserved communities, stopping puppy mills, fighting for retail sales restrictions and working globally to manage street dogs humanely. Yet U.S. shelters still euthanize 2.8 million animals per year, some communities have shockingly low spay and neuter rates, and large-scale commercial dog breeders produce 2 million puppies annually, displacing shelter pets. Worldwide, 250–300 million dogs live on the street.

    quote: "There are an estimated 23 million dogs and cats living in poverty with their loving families in the U.S., but without access to critical care and services. 80 percent of these pets have never seen a veterinarian, and 91 percent are not spayed or neutered. The HSUS is working to close these gaps &mdash; bringing critical life-saving services to pets and the families who love them."

goals:
  - "Reduce by 200,000 the number of <em>puppies produced by puppy mills</em> by strengthening animal welfare standards, restricting retail sales of puppy mill dogs and persuading pet stores to promote adoption of homeless&nbsp;animals."
  - "Extend our <em>international street dog initiative</em> to vaccinate and sterilize more than a million street dogs—and convince more governments to stop dog-killing&nbsp;programs."
  - "Expand our <em>Pets for Life</em> program, which helps local shelters and rescues reach underserved communities, providing care to 200,000 animals in the next five&nbsp;years."

    title: <strong>Inspiring Others:</strong> Don Sinex’s Story
    body: |
     <strong>Don Sinex</strong>, a real estate developer in New York City and Vermont, inherited his compassion for all animals—and especially dogs—from his mother, and now he’s dedicated to eliminating animal cruelty. A longtime friend of The HSUS, Don has given generously to our programs to save animals from cruel situations such as puppy mills. In 2014, in partnership with Shoshi Fu and Devonwood Investors LLC, Don asked that his donation be used to customize a special vehicle for our Animal Rescue Team. In recognition of his gift, the customized truck and shelter trailer will be named Rescue Team Ranger and Rescue Team Chloe after his two beloved English springer spaniels. Don hopes that generous gifts like his will inspire others to support the lifesaving work of The HSUS.
