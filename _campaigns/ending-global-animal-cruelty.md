title: "Ending Global Animal Cruelty"
description: |
  About 120 countries do not prohibit dogfighting, and a fifth of the world’s nations lack even a basic anti-cruelty statute. Many notorious U.S. dogfighting kingpins and kennels sell dogs internationally for fights in other countries. Building on our success at making dogfighting and malicious cruelty to animals a felony in all 50 states, we’ll export this successful approach internationally.

caption: "Even after the fight is over, dogfighting dogs aren’t safe. They sometimes die from their wounds or are killed if they lost the fight."

    title: <strong>Inspiring Others:</strong> Don Sinex’s Story
    body: |
     <strong>Don Sinex</strong>, a real estate developer in New York City and Vermont, inherited his compassion for all animals—and especially dogs—from his mother, and now he’s dedicated to eliminating animal cruelty. A longtime friend of The HSUS, Don has given generously to our programs to save animals from cruel situations such as puppy mills. In 2014, in partnership with Shoshi Fu and Devonwood Investors LLC, Don asked that his donation be used to customize a special vehicle for our Animal Rescue Team. In recognition of his gift, the customized truck and shelter trailer will be named Rescue Team Ranger and Rescue Team Chloe after his two beloved English springer spaniels. Don hopes that generous gifts like his will inspire others to support the lifesaving work of The HSUS.
