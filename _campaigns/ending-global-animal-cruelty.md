title: "Ending Global Animal Cruelty"
description: |
  About 120 countries do not prohibit dogfighting. A fifth of the world’s nations lack even a basic anti-cruelty statute. Many notorious U.S. dogfighting kingpins and kennels sell dogs internationally for fights in other countries. Building on our success at making dogfighting and malicious cruelty to animals a felony in all 50 states, we’ll export this successful approach internationally.

caption: "Even after the fight is over, dogfighting dogs aren’t safe. They sometimes die from their wounds or are killed if they lost the fight."

      <em>PROTECTING ANIMALS</em> from the worst forms of cruelty <em>IS PART OF A CIVIL SOCIETY</em>, and it’s time for every nation in the world to have that. <em>YOU...CAN MAKE IT A REALITY</em>.<br>—Ian Somerholder<br>Actor, <em>Vampire Diaries</em>

goals:
  - Expand our network of offices and representatives into 20 new countries with the gravest cruelty problems and the best opportunities to solve those problems.
  - Ban dogfighting in 10 countries and reduce dogfighting by 15 percent in Costa Rica and the Philippines, as measured by raids, arrests and dogfighting rings dismantled.
  - Dismantle 30 of the largest organized dogfighting networks in the United States.
