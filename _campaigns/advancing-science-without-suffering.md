title: "Advancing Science Without Suffering"
description: |
  Each year in laboratories around the world, millions of animals suffer and die in cruel chemical-poisoning tests for products we use every day, despite growing recognition of flaws inherent in such tests. We’re spearheading a global campaign to ban animal testing for cosmetics and to replace 1940s-era tests on rats, rabbits and dogs with superior modern alternatives based on 21st century science.

    quote: "Rabbits, guinea pigs, mice and rats are all routinely used in tests designed to determine the degree to which a substance can harm them. The tests are unreliable and the actual consumer protections are overstated."

    title: <strong>Inspiring Others:</strong> Don Sinex’s Story
    body: |
     <strong>Don Sinex</strong>, a real estate developer in New York City and Vermont, inherited his compassion for all animals—and especially dogs—from his mother, and now he’s dedicated to eliminating animal cruelty. A longtime friend of The HSUS, Don has given generously to our programs to save animals from cruel situations such as puppy mills. In 2014, in partnership with Shoshi Fu and Devonwood Investors LLC, Don asked that his donation be used to customize a special vehicle for our Animal Rescue Team. In recognition of his gift, the customized truck and shelter trailer will be named Rescue Team Ranger and Rescue Team Chloe after his two beloved English springer spaniels. Don hopes that generous gifts like his will inspire others to support the lifesaving work of The HSUS.
