title: "Advancing Science Without Suffering"
description: |
  Millions of animals are used in cosmetic and toxicity tests worldwide, despite growing recognition of flaws inherent in such tests. We’ve already partnered with Procter & Gamble to develop AltTox.org, a site dedicated to advancing non-animal methods of toxicity testing. We can build on that momentum to promote 21st-century science and speed the adoption of alternatives.

      <em>If every cosmetic tested on rabbits or mice had a photo on the packaging showing these animals with weeping swollen eyes and inflamed skin, <em>I BELIEVE EVERYONE WOULD LEAVE CRUELTY ON THE SHELF.</em>—Paul McCartney<br>Musician, The Beatles

goals:
  - Ban testing cosmetics on animals or enact import/ sales bans of animal-tested cosmetics in three major markets and make progress toward ending mandatory cosmetics animal testing in China.
  - Promote the adoption of animal-testing alternatives in international industry regulations.
  - Accelerate the development of next-generation animal-testing alternatives by steering public and private funding toward non-animal technologies.
