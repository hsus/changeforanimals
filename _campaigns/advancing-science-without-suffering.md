title: "Advancing Science Without Suffering"
description: |
  Millions of animals are used in cosmetic and toxicity tests worldwide, despite growing recognition of flaws inherent in such tests. We’ve already partnered with Procter & Gamble to develop AltTox.org, a site dedicated to advancing non-animal methods of toxicity testing. We can build on that momentum to promote 21st-century science and speed the adoption of alternatives.

      If every cosmetic tested on rabbits or mice had a photo on the packaging showing these animals with weeping swollen eyes and inflamed skin, <em>I BELIEVE EVERYONE WOULD LEAVE CRUELTY ON THE SHELF.</em>

    title: <strong>Inspiring Others:</strong> Don Sinex’s Story
    body: |
     <strong>Don Sinex</strong>, a real estate developer in New York City and Vermont, inherited his compassion for all animals—and especially dogs—from his mother, and now he’s dedicated to eliminating animal cruelty. A longtime friend of The HSUS, Don has given generously to our programs to save animals from cruel situations such as puppy mills. In 2014, in partnership with Shoshi Fu and Devonwood Investors LLC, Don asked that his donation be used to customize a special vehicle for our Animal Rescue Team. In recognition of his gift, the customized truck and shelter trailer will be named Rescue Team Ranger and Rescue Team Chloe after his two beloved English springer spaniels. Don hopes that generous gifts like his will inspire others to support the lifesaving work of The HSUS.
