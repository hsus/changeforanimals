    <span class="post">For <i>over 60 years</i>, The Humane Society of the United States has made unprecedented change for animals</span>
    <span class="more">. We’ve taken on the biggest fights wherever we find them: on the ground, in the boardroom, in the courts and on Capitol Hill. And we work to change public opinion by bringing issues of animal cruelty out of the shadows. We’ve made momentous progress already, but we’re setting our sights even higher. With your help, our campaign to create transformational change for all animals will raise $60 million, enabling us to have a far greater impact and wider reach than before.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span class="more">Although we and our affiliates provide hands-on care and services to more than 100,000 animals every year,</span> <span class="pre initial-caps">our goal has always been to <i>enact change</i> by attacking the root causes of animal cruelty.</span> <span class="more">We target institutions and practices that affect millions and even billions of animals—like factory farms, puppy mills, inhumane wildlife management programs and animal-testing labs—and work to become part of the solution. We offer alternatives and help develop more humane practices to ensure lasting change. Our staff is comprised of experts in their fields, whose technical knowledge is matched only by their compassion for animals.</span>
    <br class="more"><br class="more">
    <span class="more">We’ve done so much already.</span> <span class="post">We’ve made sweeping policy and business changes</span><span class="more">, from making animal cruelty a felony in all 50 states (up from just four states in the mid-1980s) to convincing more than 100 major food retailers to remove extreme confinement of farm animals from their supply chains. We’ve galvanized the public to push for reform,</span><br class="less"><br class="less"> <span class="pre">and we’ve never been better placed to <i>take on the issues</i> that still exist.</span>
    <br class="more"><br class="more">
    <span class="more">More than any other animal welfare organization, we have the reach and the power to make changes that affect millions of animals nationwide. We’ve gained momentum every year, and we’ve reached a tipping point. During the next five years, we intend to push animal welfare even further into the public consciousness and enact changes that will affect millions more of our fellow creatures.</span> <span>The time to act is now.</span>
    <br><br><br class="less">
    <span class="period italic"><i>We hope that you will join us</i></span> <span class="more">in creating transformational change for animals and staying the course until reform is realized.</span>

      <h3 class="more">The Humane Society of the United States transforms animal lives every day. For more than 60 years, we’ve confronted animal cruelty wherever we find it. We’re poised to take our work to the next level—with your help.</h3>
      

      <p class="list-top">Five themes will guide our work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing 21st century solutions to move away from cruel and archaic practices</li>
        <li>Transitioning to a humane economy that syncs our commercial and social behavior with our core values concerning the proper treatment of animals</li>
        <li>Expanding the notion of civil society throughout the world by promoting kindness to animals, while working to upgrade legal standards</li>
        <li>Broadening our campaigns globally and scaling them up accordingly</li>
        <li>Taking animal protection to the next level to achieve even more meaningful gains in the biggest and most urgent areas of need</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="more">
        With these themes in mind, we’ve identified five areas where we’re on the verge of big change. We’ve developed realistic, achievable action plans with five-year milestones and metrics. In summary, we will focus on helping pets in poverty, stopping animal cruelty around the world, advancing alternatives to cruel cosmetic and toxicity testing, changing the course for farm animals and forging a new wildlife management paradigm.
      </p>
      <br class="more"><br class="more">
      <p class="more">I’m confident The HSUS can achieve these goals. Our record of change is unmatched by similar organizations, and we’re at a crucial point in history. With this campaign—and with your support—we can build on that record and expand our reach.</p>
      <br class="more"><br class="more">
      <p class="more">Please join us. Together, we can achieve groundbreaking transformational change for animals.</p>
