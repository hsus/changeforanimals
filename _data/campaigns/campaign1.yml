  Makes It Possible

title: "Helping Pets in Poverty"
description: "We’ve made great strides in providing services to underserved communities, stopping puppy mills, fighting for retail sales restrictions and working globally to manage street dogs humanely. Yet U.S. shelters still have great pets available, some communities have shockingly low spay and neuter rates and large-scale commercial dog breeders produce 2 million puppies annually, displacing shelter pets. Worldwide, 250–300 million dogs live on the street."

  There are an *ESTIMATED 23 MILLION DOGS AND CATS LIVING IN POVERTY* with their loving families in the U.S., but without access to critical care and services. 80 percent of these pets have never seen a veterinarian, and 91 percent are not spayed or neutered. *THE HSUS IS WORKING TO CLOSE THESE GAP*s -- bringing critical life-saving services to pets and the families who love them.
