title: "Resolving Wildlife Conflicts"
description: "Wild animals have suffered too much, for too long, because of outdated, destructive andlethal “solutions” to human-wildlife conflicts. We need humane, science-based approaches to co-existing with our wild neighbors. We’re on the forefront of this research, carrying out innovative deer immunocontraception research projects in partnership with leading veterinary medicine schools."
