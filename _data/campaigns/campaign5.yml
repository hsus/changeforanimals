  **$5.8 MILLION**  
  Builds Momentum
title: Advancing Science Without Suffering
description: Millions of animals are used in cosmetic  and toxicity tests worldwide, despite  growing recognition of flaws inherent in  such tests. We’ve already partnered with  Procter & Gamble to develop AltTox.org,  a site dedicated to advancing non-animal  methods of toxicity testing. We can build  on that momentum to promote 21st-century science and speed the adoption  of alternatives.
